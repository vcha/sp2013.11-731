six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on 7 october as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to them refusing to give the city access to health care funds , managed by groups of workers , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт , said that the layoffs were part of the budget , which they have signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 , said that they have with the notice claims , the department of education , warning that filed a lawsuit against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce a formal file a lawsuit in state supreme court in manhattan .

language may seem innocuous , but still no discussion on libya took place easily .
kerry and mccain introduced a resolution in june that allows for the limited use of the american armed forces in libya .
but in that same day , when the bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also has not supported a proposal which would cut funding for the u.s. mission in libya .
resolution of the committee on foreign affairs " admires the people of libya for his incredible bravery and the formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanks the men and women of the armed forces of the united states and their coalition partners , who took part in the military operation to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism .

this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives , republican bob гудлатом ( virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else that will be on the plenary vote of congress this session .
amendment гудлата is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that affect a wide range of issues , which have been made in this meeting .
there is at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the house of representatives and much else about the " control of federal spending . "
the budget control act , which was held in august , and demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted for a balanced budget amendment .
in addition to the budget , some congressmen want to limit the number of deadlines of members of congress , jose serrano ( democrat and member of the house of representatives , new york ) wants to abolish the restriction of the two terms for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages already offer for many years , and as another , effectively banning flag burning .
no matter how to members of congress to propose amendments , they are no faster than in the past few years .
this rate pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s , when members of congress , according to the library of the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments to every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , the 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in congress she actually was in 1789 .

this is a very sensitive topic for commanders , who do not want to seem ungrateful or objecting to society , which they serve .
as a result , most conversations about the pity is going on quietly and just between the two of combat veterans .
some people will look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and there were in the exotic locations .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible work in washington , dc immediately after the combat tour .
awkwardness , that military experience , in part derives from the american indifference to the wars .
" we , as a nation , no longer appreciate military heroism , as it was quite often in world war ii , " says lieutenant - general in the resignation of david бэрноу , who commanded the american troops in afghanistan .

six gave positive the characteristics of the accused , the man who was eventually acquitted .
" i thought that i now give birth to a " i ran out of the courtroom with crying . "
lyman was ordered to appeal to the military psychiatrist , who ultimately diagnosed her change in personality that made her intolerable to the service .
продвинется whether forward the case , by the lyman and its comrades in the lawsuit , is a complicated question , " says john turley , professor of law in the name of george washington university school of law .
between them and the verdict is the doctrine that criticize since she appeared .
army lagged for decades , because it does not have those incentives and impeding the funds , which imposes responsibility .
these things will change only at a time when good people would want to fight .
" we will continue to fight with the army on the subject , until the reforms , " she says . "

recent research by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who talked about their drunken exploits on facebook were significantly more at risk for alcoholism , rather than students who were silent on this occasion .
" you ca n't solve the problem , not her , " said washington post димитри выявив христакис moreno , the co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development , and in the seattle children 's research institute .
facebook also constantly draws all kinds of data about its users .

around 30 survivors and victims ' relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i became a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea about what he is part of a large " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he 's not a mad , and said that there is no proof that he acted with accomplices .
but this does not diminish automatically grief and confusion , which is now feels the whole nation .

attended , among others , mitch mcconnell , the leader of the republican in the senate and a prominent opponent of health - care law .
nothing new : two judges attend the event of society federalists already for many years .
in fact , the judges are free of the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the sheer intimacy scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to the company with big financial interests , it was sufficient signal for the activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign to raise money with lawyers and the things which are now viewed in court . "
scalia and thomas are unlikely to pay attention to critics who say they are quite willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in matters of groups like the society federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that it is in relation to the judge elena kagan is the question of ethics , rather than scalia and thomas .
her criticism , demanded that kagan has abandoned its hearings on this case , because she was too involved in the protection of the law then , to be impartial now .

раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia can be up to some extent is protected by , but she ca n't be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union had been severely undercut by the european debt crisis in the past few months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's commerce minister , said that " india will do everything , that will be able to help the eurozone , " as its own economy is now declining exports and inflows of foreign capital .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with his own deep - seated economic problems .

mr. нэг , said the eurozone crisis threatened " significant direct effects throughout asia . "
he said that the vulnerable emerging markets need to make a " contingency plans " , to protect themselves from the downturn and the most significant оттоков capital flows out of their economies .
minister of defense leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and cause financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan , on the line and to civil assembly .
" the implications of these reductions would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators .
" these changes would undermine confidence in those who support our army , and will bring serious damage combat readiness . "
" while the military financing in overseas contingency operations do not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to the опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release of the pentagon from reductions , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week 's defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops from the shell , but without the core .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles , including those that have already been undergoing tests , and only some of the early stages of planning .
termination of the further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that it is vitally important next step to improve and confront potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign - related укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors , which must be taught the opposite , sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be out of this draw the conclusion that liars it is difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the extensive and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe behind the asphyxia , laughing , voice characteristics of your facility .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering the complicated issue : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lie , but to master the skill of deception detection can be .

модоло рольдан and байона with experience in the city building , called the proposal as " intellectual challenge " with " some risks . "
the first fear is the restriction of the border , where you can build .
" we need to think about the new urban planning tools , because the current [ with regard to the general capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to the real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already has a work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " since the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which sets the name of this part of the complex , as in the contest rules lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting competitions , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal - reading to see and understand the area as a whole . "
on the other hand , the project for some , the gate could overlap on the programme and identifying with the project architect for the neighboring gate .

he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight - so - called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said specialist in the field of chemical engineering .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
a movement of the vehicles and latch efforts , it helps to be very well on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the latest layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear also requires the proper thickness , and it is necessary to take into consideration the material , from which he is .

if there is a topic , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of the emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build my own opinion on the objective facts and data on the sound .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production constantly , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to deal with climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate .
that 's one reason why germany remains alone in the decision to abandon the nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is only a few of those , who strongly continues to their projects .
although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefiting from low - cost electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose this type of energy in the principle .
heavily export - oriented , she draws an entire contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that may not be moved to another industry .
what engineer and electrician would order the epr , calculated to sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
development of areva solutions with a low - carbon , nuclear and renewable energy sources , indicates взаимодополнимости .
security in france we have a body , which carries out , too , and transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
nuclear industry has survived three serious incident in the coming 50 years .
device in the chernobyl reactor , and unforgivable human error led to a tragedy .
the nuclear industry will extract the lessons from the accident , as a learned from the previous two .
as he viewed all the specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift for menacing rivals areva and edf , ​​путь them toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , he said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
francois hollande was confined to platitudes , in his program , saying that " the joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей latest data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on the economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most skilled - dynamic sectors , where training is not linked to offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is the most valuable acquisition ; but it at the same time , and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to hold the vote and to make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , even though and is a necessary condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as when something republican philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we 'll win nothing , requiring a series of national referendums , organized by the need and in хаотическом order .
no , we dream , but not on the edge of guillotine on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choices and democracy , this time at the pan - european level .
the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of its nations together with her .
because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this socialist proposals and jacques delors now require all of the european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life , граздан , is a madness and a dead end .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary " to create a " republicans ' .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .

the international community , led by the washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the problems that creates a boko haram .
it is focused mainly on the church , and bars and the state authorities .
in the past christmas day she took responsibility for the diluted earnings per share as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja .
in august , the local branch of the united nations , will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has strengthened in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram poses a new continent .

mitt romney , who has the best chances of the nomination from the " good old party " , has threatened to sue chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration for their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former president obama 's ambassador in china and the only candidate , the complicated foreign policy , could not overcome position , that appeasing emotions .
but huntsman , who is held in the lower part of the rating has remained неуслышанным .
romney has also vowed the military strikes against iran if sanctions wo n't be able to halt its nuclear program .

gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .

funding for natural gas pipeline was provided on the 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 % of the bank credit .
out of the baltic sea gas pipeline in lubmin on a sandy beach , mulberry coniferous trees .
sensors measure the pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before he sucked it in the german gas pipelines .
