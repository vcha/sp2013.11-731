scalia and thomas lunch with opponents of the health care law , while the court considers the case
this incident took place in the last thursday , when all nine justices met to discuss filed petitions for review .
judges have agreed to consider the process ; in fact , behalterbau debate lasting in 5 1/2 hours are expected in march 2012 , but the outcome will likely become a hindrance in the presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time , when a court decision .
clement , a law firm bancroft pllc , was one of the nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of federalists , long - existing groups , constantly , conservative legal principles .
another event was sponsored by pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which is a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
attended , among others , mitch mcconnell , senate republican leader and a prominent opponent of health care law .
nothing new : two judges attend the event of federalists for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nonetheless , the sheer proximity to scalia and thomas two legal firms in this case , as well as the company to big financial interests , was enough to signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , which now covers the court . "
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to the critics who say they are very willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in matters of groups like the federalist society .

the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction from the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" while foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff would be reduced , which will lead to опозданиям staff with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to the pentagon 's budget compromise or strengthen calls for release from cutbacks , will see later .
at a press conference last week , defense secretary painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further troops -- with shell , but without the nucleus .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way , or " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lie , but to master the skill of deception detection can be .

on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - so that 's just a few of those , who resolutely keeps his projects .
although the german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs that may not be moved to another industry .
what engineer and electrician would order the epr , calculated to sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
development of low - carbon solutions by areva , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies взаимодополнимости sources .
security in france we have a body , which carries out , too , and transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three serious incident .
in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as learned from the previous two .
as it is all the specialists in the field of energy to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift to areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
francois hollande , in their program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people who will determine our future , may 2011 , princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants based on the view that they 're able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking lower wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the proposals work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and it is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates -- large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is fragile and valuable acquisition ; but at the same time .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to hold the vote and to make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become the " tool of suppression , " as when a republican philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we dream , but not on the edge of guillotine on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - on and democracy , this time the pan - european level .
the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with her each of its nations .
because only collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , had to " create a " republican .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
in fact , the 2011 completed 11 % sales growth of the world bank cards , mobile phones with chips ( sim - cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million units .
this year in the world will be sold in the 460 million smart cards against бесконтактных 320 million a year earlier .

" two large organizations in france promised in the future has systematically to distribute among their clients , bank cards , adapted for non - use , " said gerard небуи , director - general of the visa europe , france .

crédit agricole yesterday announced the experiment from december to june next year in the massacre .
long confirmed предполагавшиеся links between the terrorist group al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian boko haram sect .

among the debris left after the operation , french and нигерские investigators found a few telephone sim card belonging to the terrorists .
analysis of the incidents , pointed to several calls were in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but of course , you have to wait for more reliable evidence , before you talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the challenges posed by boko haram .
it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in past christmas , she took responsibility for action , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе for one another , and then in abuja .
in august , the local office of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when aqmi has in mali and niger and somalis in kenya of al-shabaab are boko haram , a new threat to the continent .
weakened by crisis , america can lead a complex world with the help of the ordinary , or rather simplistic ideas ?
for a few days , mitt romney , the distance , rick perry and other multiply loud , but without details statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally strong republicans .
mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from " good old " party , has threatened to sue chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive issue for america , migration is as much as their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the difficult foreign policy , could n't overcome position which indulging your emotions .
but huntsman , who has been at the bottom of the ratings , remained неуслышанным .
romney has also promised the military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they remind us that obama himself was amateur , and that he had to lower the tone about the fight against terror .
after iraq , it does not believe in the military intervention , which confused in the sand .
nord stream , new gates for the entry of russian gas to europe .
he is on the supply of gas equivalent of 30 million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and government participated in last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new gas pipeline , which directly links russia and germany under water .
on a new pipeline 27.5 million of additional cubic metres of gas will come every year in western europe for the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region with the land of mecklenburg - western pomerania .
and the opportunity to build the pipeline on the same direction have already been discussed .
these two countries will lose part of its power : they will be more difficult to influence russia , threatening to shut down access to western european markets .
but the price of europe 's energy , because the project has created a gap between eastern and western europe .
" this pipeline is a part of the cooperation with russia , a new artery that connects us organically , " said francois fillon , opening the gas pipeline , showing the extent to which the large natural gas contracts are important politically and economically .

the pipeline is a long metal snake weight , equal weight 242 эйфелевых towers , without breaks throughout its length , without the service stations .
" we close the flow of gas in the case of accident less than a minute , " says jens muller .
but this seems unlikely that piping designers seams , designed for протечку only once in 100,000 years .
сигароообразный e420 is inside a 1 - meter diameter pipeline and pushed forward the flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the northern flow , which has been commissioned to build and operate gas pipeline .
then gazprom gave the company leases the twenty years with the possibility of extension of the entire gas transportation .
natural gas pipeline was financed by 30 % shareholders and 70 % of bank loans .
out of the baltic sea gas pipeline in lubmin on a sandy beach , mulberry coniferous trees .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before sucked him in the german gas pipelines .
at full capacity it will be 3 million an hour , and 6 million in 2012 .
