раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
asia may be up to some extent protected , " but she ca n't be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's commerce minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and a reduction in foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring the financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly .
" the implications of these reductions would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators .
" these changes would undermine confidence in those who support our army , and will bring serious damage combat readiness . "
" although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to the опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release of the pentagon from reductions , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense secretary painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further troops -- with shell , but without the nucleus .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles , including those that have already been undergoing tests , and only some of the early stages of planning .
termination of the further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that it is vitally important next step to improve and confront potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
ex - presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in the financial machinations during the campaign , related укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors , who should be to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be out of this draw the conclusion that liars it is difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or governance .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone could use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lie , but to master the skill of deception detection can be .

i ask you about that , because there is a loyalty to the group ; fans live in a state of tension in the days before the concert .
thank you for that have been with us all these years .
some of the people , in anticipation of your concert , relate to him as a great show of himself .

we trust each other 's music , and all could not be better .
we care about , in order not to be too long in the round , because it is easy to get involved in this game , large crowds and the people who love your music .
how do you remember your other project , manother love bone ?
we were a group of almost three years and not released a single album , until the death of andy ( andrew woods ) .
this was a wonderful person , and we 're skuchaem on it .
it is true that you 're familiar with its work , especially eddie веддера , and therefore you choose it for the opening ?
why do you constantly change the words in the yellow ledbetter at concerts ?
he sings it , and i think , he uses the first thing that comes to him in the head .
so many of them , that i can talk all day about басистах , whom i love .
i think that we all feel a certain гранж alienated from the rest of the word .
at first , your music was much more gloomy , but now she has become more positive .
it 's interesting , because , i think , there are a few songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , though they may sound a bit positive .
i think that when you grow , and in your life was kind of trauma and you have lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music , and these two songs , of course , reflect this to me .

the architects agree with the possibility of the contest after wrangling of the contributions

moreover , it is accompanied by comparing the new york in the pictures with the central park .
it was so , until , in september , the council announced a huge event , consisting of 16 contests for the gates in many other кольсеролу .
so , or if someone wants to put the gates on the field .
competition , and their organizational side , and their impact on the city , architects are the topic for discussion of all barcelona .
and this fact leads to precisely one of the few coincidences between what they say barcelona 's three architect and the scientists who attended .
for рольдана , after reaching the shoreline is becoming a " necessary " to discuss " the front side of the mountain " , when the proposal ильдефона серды , al gore with green apples , was not done .
модоло as рольдан and байона with experience in the city building , called the proposal as " intellectual challenge " with " some of the dangers " .
the first fear is the restriction of the border , where you can build .
" we need to think about the new urban planning tools , because the current [ with regard to the general capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to the real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already has a work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " since the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which sets the name of this part of the complex , as in the contest rules lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting competitions , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal - reading to see and understand the area as a whole . "
on the other hand , the project for some , the gate could overlap on the programme and identifying with the project architect for the neighboring gate .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - modified bitumen , to produce a mix of the best quality , sustainable to the impact of the environment and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , said that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition both at high , and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight - so - called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in the area of chemical engineering .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
a movement of vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces to be distributed on the road to cover very well .
the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the latest layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and finds it difficult to go from there , and it causes размягчение all sectors of the cover , and therefore education yam .

what lacked candidate from the valle , in order to become a new miss colombia ?
at this time мелина ramirez serna was supposed to be contented with what was on the podium winners with a silver crown and ribbon , proclaiming her new princess colombia .
the first factor played a pivotal role in the jury to award her the title of the first princess , was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question " what the book describes you , and why ? , the specified martin мурилье гомесом from literary society let 's honor .
" i read a lot of books , i believe in literature , i think it is a form of окультуривания , and certainly i think that the book that characterizes my childhood -- " the little prince " is a pretty deep book .

"
although in both cases , she looked confident , it was obvious that she was not enough force and energy , which showed representatives магдалены and атлантико .

between the magazine , journalist guido ойос кромос believes that representatives of the valle de cauca error was that she has undergone major surgery .
her body has never been her advantage , and here she was punished for it .
so it or not , the fact is that today , мелины begins a year of the board , not as the queen , but as a princess , position , which allows her to represent colombia directly on one of the international competition , the organizers of the national contest .

if there is a topic , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of the emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production constantly , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to deal with climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate .
that 's one reason why germany remains alone in the decision to abandon the nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is only a few of those , who strongly continues to their projects .
although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , she draws an entire contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that may not be moved to another industry .

device in the chernobyl reactor , and unforgivable human error led to a tragedy .
the nuclear industry will extract the lessons from this accident , as learned from the two of previous ones .

then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " do n't need foreign bricklayers , talents , and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
francois hollande , in his program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most skilled in dynamic sectors , where the training is not associated with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the organization of labor , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , it is enough to vote and to make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we 'll win nothing , requiring a series of national referendums , organized by the need and in хаотическом order .
there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of its nations together with her .
because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this socialist proposals and jacques delors now require all of the european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary " to create a " republicans ' .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .

" for many years , it is well known that sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside , and that she is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigerian researcher .
the international community , led by the washington now has put pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the boko haram , which creates problems .
she is focused mainly on the church , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas day she took responsibility for the diluted earnings per share as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja .
in august , the local branch of the united nations , will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has strengthened in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram poses a new continent .

mitt romney , who has the best chances of the nomination from the " good old party " , has threatened to sue chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration for their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former president obama 's ambassador in china and the only candidate , the complicated foreign policy , could not overcome position , that appeasing emotions .
but huntsman , who is held in the bottom part of the ratings stayed неуслышанным .
romney has also promised to military strikes on iran , if sanctions wo n't be able to halt its nuclear program .
